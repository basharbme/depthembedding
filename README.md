# DepthEmbedding

This code repository implements the DepthEmbedding algorithm for the estimation of the depth-dependent forward model of gamma cameras (monolithic and non-monolithic). 

The algorithm is described in [1]. 


# How to use

Download the two test data zip files from http://tomographylab.scienceontheweb.net/depthembedding/, uncompressed them, then in the same folder run the 
following command:  
python article.py
